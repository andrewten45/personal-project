# personal-projects

## Description
This repository includes my personal projects.
It may include ideas or programs.
They're all written in C++, which is my preferred programming language.

Most programs here are stored in their respective folder and are designed to be opened with an IDE.
The files in "old" are miscellaneous cpp files.

## Important Note
To take or edit parts of code or files from this repository, one needs my permission first.
