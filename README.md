# personal-projects

This repository includes my personal projects.
It may include ideas or programs.
They're all written in C++, which is my preferred programming language.

Only programs in the "favorites" folder are designed to be modified with an IDE; the rest are plain cpp files.

Important Note: To take or edit parts of code or files from this repository, one needs my permission first.
